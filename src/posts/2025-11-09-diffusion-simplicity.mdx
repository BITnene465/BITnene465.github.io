## Why simplicity matters

The Playground demos lean on tiny diffusion checkpoints so I can explain each knob live. The
current prototype focuses on:

- **One latent edit** at a time so we can trace gradients without screen clutter.
- **Graph hooks** that mirror the research pipeline from the main papers.
- **Playable presets** that map directly to the HoloBoard retrospective UI.

## What still needs work

1. Record better latency numbers on consumer GPUs.
2. Translate the best presets into MDX shortcodes so blog posts can embed the same widgets.
3. Borrow the anime-inspired UI framing from CelShade to keep the visuals coherent.
